## ✅ Features

### 📥 CSV-Based Data Loading
- **Department, Course, Student Import**: Loads from `departments.csv`, `courses.csv`, `students.csv`.
- **Curriculum Mapping by Department ID**: Dynamically loads curriculum from CSV using a department-to-curriculum mapping.

### 👨‍🎓 Student Transcript Operations
- **Student ID Validation**: Ensures valid 7-digit student ID.
- **Individual Transcript Download**: Fetch and generate transcript for a specific student.
- **Bulk Transcript Download**: Generate transcripts for all students in a department.
- **HTML Transcript Output**: Transcripts are exported in clean HTML format.

### 📂 Department & Student Management
- **View All Departments**: Displays a list of all departments with their IDs.
- **List All Students**: Prints detailed info about all students.

### 🧮 GPA and Curriculum Handling
- **Curriculum Loader**: Loads curriculum with prerequisites for a student’s department.
- **Dynamic Course Assignment**: Courses and grades are randomly loaded from mock data.
- **Transcript Generator**: Computes semester GPAs, CGPAs, and passed credits.

### 🛠 Utility Functions
- `isValidStudent_id(student_id: str) -> bool`: Validates 7-digit numeric student IDs.
- `is_valid_semester_format(semester: str) -> bool`: Checks if semester follows `YYYYx` format.
- `translate_semester_type(semester: str) -> str`: Translates semester codes to readable terms (e.g., `20231` → `Fall 2023–2024`).

### 📋 Menu-Driven CLI
- **User Interaction**: Menu loop with options to view students, departments, or generate transcripts.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Handles invalid IDs and input with meaningful error messages.
